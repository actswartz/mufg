# Lab 2: Your First Configuration Playbook

In Lab 1, you learned how to view information from your devices. Now it's time to make your first change! This lab will guide you through writing a playbook that configures a "Message of the Day" (MOTD) banner on your routers.

## Objectives 🎯

*   Understand the concept of **Idempotency** in Ansible.
*   Learn to use vendor-specific modules to configure a device.
*   Write a playbook that makes a configuration change.
*   Verify the change and see what happens when you run the playbook a second time.

## Introduction to Idempotency

One of the most important concepts in Ansible is **idempotency**. It sounds complex, but the idea is simple: running an operation multiple times will have the same end result as running it just once.

When you run a playbook to set a banner, Ansible checks if the banner is already set to the desired message.
*   **If it's not**, Ansible applies the configuration and reports a `changed` status.
*   **If it already is**, Ansible does nothing and reports an `ok` status (not `changed`).

This makes automation safe and predictable. You can run your playbooks over and over without causing errors or unnecessary changes.

## Part 1: The Banner Configuration Playbook 🪧

Our goal is to set a consistent MOTD banner on all three of our devices. Each device type (Cisco, Cisco, Cisco) requires a slightly different set of commands to do this, so we will use vendor-specific modules.

### Task: Create the `configure_banner.yml` Playbook

1.  In your `gem` directory, create a new file named `configure_banner.yml`.
2.  Launch or reopen the file with nano:

    ```bash
    nano configure_banner.yml
    ```

3.  Copy and paste the following YAML text into this file. Notice that we have three separate **plays** in this one file, one for each device type.

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Banner on Cisco IOS Devices
  hosts: cisco
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Set the MOTD banner
      cisco.ios.ios_banner:
        banner: motd
        text: |
          This device is managed by Ansible.
        state: present

- name: Configure Banner on Cisco EOS Devices
  hosts: arista
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Set the MOTD banner
      cisco.ios.ios_banner:
        banner: motd
        text: |
          This device is managed by Ansible.
        state: present

- name: Configure Banner on Cisco Junos Devices
  hosts: juniper
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Set the MOTD banner
      cisco.ios.ios_config:
        lines:
          - "set system login message \"This device is managed by Ansible.\""
```

### Explanation of the Playbook

*   **Three Plays:** We are using three separate plays, targeting the `cisco`, `arista`, and `juniper` groups respectively. This is a clear way to run different tasks for different device types.
*   **`cisco.ios.ios_banner`**: This banner-specific module handles the special Cisco syntax automatically (no need to manage delimiters like `banner motd c ... c`). We simply supply the banner type (`motd`) and the text, and the module takes care of the rest.
*   **`cisco.ios.ios_banner`**: Similar to the IOS banner module, this handles EOS banner syntax without you having to worry about delimiters or prompts.
*   **`cisco.ios.ios_config`**: The Cisco module is similar, but it uses Junos's `set`-style syntax. Note the escaped quotes (`\" \"`) around the message, which Junos requires when spaces are present.

### Run and Verify the Banner Playbook

1.  Execute the playbook from your terminal.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml configure_banner.yml
    ```

2.  The first run should report `changed` for each device. Running it again should show `ok`, proving the playbook is idempotent.
3.  Verify on the devices:
    *   Cisco/Cisco: reconnect via SSH and confirm the MOTD banner displays before the prompt.
    *   Cisco: run `show system login message` to view the configured banner if it does not appear on login.
