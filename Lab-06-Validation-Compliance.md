# Lab 6: Automation for Validation and Compliance

So far, you have been using Ansible to *push* configuration to devices. This is often called "Day 1" automation. Now, you will learn to use Ansible for "Day 2" operations: **validating** that your network is operating as expected and is in compliance with your standards.

Instead of changing configuration, this playbook will run `show` commands, check the output for specific values, and either pass or fail based on what it finds.

## Objectives 🎯

*   Learn to use vendor-specific `_command` modules to run operational commands.
*   Use the `register` keyword to save the output of a task to a variable.
*   Learn to use the `assert` module to validate data and test for compliance.
*   Build a playbook that checks the operational state of OSPF and compliance of NTP settings.

## Part 1: The Validation Playbook 🧪

Our goal is to create a single playbook that can be run at any time to perform a health check on our network. It will verify three key things:
1.  Are the OSPF neighbor adjacencies `FULL`?
2.  Does R1 have a valid OSPF route to R3's loopback?
3.  Are all devices still configured with the correct NTP server?

This playbook will use no configuration modules. It is purely for reading and checking state.

### Task: Create the `validate_network.yml` Playbook

1.  In your `gem` directory, create a new file named `validate_network.yml`.
2.  Launch or reopen the file with nano:

    ```bash
    nano validate_network.yml
    ```

3.  Copy and paste the following YAML into the file.

```yaml

### Explanation of the Playbook

*   **`register:` variables**: Each vendor-specific command saves its output into a register (e.g., `r_cisco_ospf_neighbors`, `r_arista_ntp_config`). This keeps the results separate so later tasks on the same host can safely reference the data without being overwritten by tasks for other platforms.
*   **`when:` statements**: Every command/assert pair is guarded with a `when` so it only runs on the appropriate devices. This avoids unnecessary connections and ensures the register variables exist before we reference them.
*   **`ansible.builtin.assert`**: This module checks the conditions you list in the `that:` block. If any condition is false, the entire playbook fails for that host. This is exactly what we want for a validation test! The expressions inside `that:` are already Jinja, so do **not** wrap them in `{{ }}`. Use concatenation like `' ' ~ ...` when you need to build strings, as shown in the route validation task.
*   **Connection handling**: Leave `connection` unset in the play so that each host uses the value from `inventory`. Cisco/Cisco will use `network_cli` while Cisco keeps `netconf`, which is required for the Junos modules.
*   **NTP prerequisite**: These compliance checks assume each router was previously configured with the Lab 3 NTP server (`130.126.24.24`). If you haven't run your `base_config`/Lab 3 playbooks recently, reapply them (or manually configure `ntp server 130.126.24.24`) before running this validation playbook.
*   `fail_msg` / `success_msg`: These make the output of the playbook very easy to read, telling you exactly what passed or failed.
*   **Filters (`| ipaddr('address')`, `| default('')`)**:
    *   `ipaddr('address')` is a filter that extracts just the IP address from a prefix (e.g., `10.222.201.3/32` -> `10.222.201.3`).
    *   `default('')` is another safety mechanism. If the `stdout` doesn't exist, it provides an empty string instead of causing an error.

### Note:  the Cisco device actually has two neighbors. 
We are only checking if the word "FULL" shows up in standard out.
 a more accurate way to check would be, but we have not covered all of these topics.
 ```yaml
---
- name: 1. VALIDATE OSPF NEIGHBORS (Cisco EOS)
  when: "'arista' in group_names"
  vars: { ospf_not_full: "{{ r_arista_ospf_neighbors.stdout | reject('search','FULL') | list }}" }
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that: ["{{ ospf_not_full | length == 0 }}"]
    fail_msg: "Neighbors NOT FULL on {{ inventory_hostname }}: {{ ospf_not_full }}"
    success_msg: "All neighbors FULL on {{ inventory_hostname }}."

```

## Part 2: Running the Validation Playbook ▶️

### Task: Run the playbook and interpret the results

1.  Execute your new validation playbook.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml validate_network.yml
    ```
    If everything is working correctly, you should see the `success_msg` for every assertion, and the play should complete successfully.

### Task: See It Fail

A test is only useful if you know it will fail when something is wrong. Let's cause a problem and see our playbook catch it.

1.  Use an ad-hoc command to shut down the OSPF-enabled interface on R1.

    ```bash
    ansible r1 -i inventory.yml -m cisco.ios.ios_config -a "parents='interface Ethernet0/0' lines='shutdown'"
    ```

2.  Wait about a minute for the OSPF adjacency to time out.
3.  Run the validation playbook again.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml validate_network.yml
    ```

This time, the playbook should fail on R1 and R2. You will see your custom `fail_msg` printed in the output, clearly stating that the OSPF neighbor is not `FULL`. The route validation on R1 will also fail.

4.  **Don't forget to bring the interface back up!**

    ```bash
    ansible r1 -i inventory.yml -m cisco.ios.ios_config -a "parents='interface Ethernet0/0' lines='no shutdown'"
    ```
    Run the validation playbook one more time to confirm everything returns to a passing state.

## Conclusion

You have now built a powerful, automated network validation and compliance tool. This type of playbook is invaluable in real-world operations for pre- and post-change validation, continuous compliance monitoring, and rapid troubleshooting.
